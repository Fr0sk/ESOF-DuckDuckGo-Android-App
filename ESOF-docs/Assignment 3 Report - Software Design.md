Introduction to Software Architecture:

Software architecture is the process of creating/implementing a development pattern to structure the software system, detailing on how to create and link the different data structures as well as documentating them.
Having a well-thought software architecture helps working together as a team, and keeping the software stable and bug-free when scalating, while keeping it's design patterns. It's also helps visualize much better the software structure and know where to implement the next feature or where could be the bug that is being traced. 

The 4+1 architectural view model is model with the goal of describing the system in the viewpoint of different stakeholders.
such as developers, users etc. These four views are: logical, implementation, deployment and process view.

* Logical View:
Shows the functionality, the key abstractions in the system as objects or object classes, or their packages provided to end-users. It uses the UML Package Diagram to describe the logical view.

* Implementation View:
Shows the system in a programer's prespective way, showing the system software is decomposed. It usually uses the UML Component Diagram to describe those sotware components.

* Deployment View:
shows the system hardware and how software components are distributed across the hardware nodes. It uses the Deplyment Diagram to describe this view.

* Process View:
Shows how the system processes interact, showing how processes communicate, and the run time behavior the system. Uses the activity diagram to discribe the process view.

* Use Case View (+1):
Joins the other views and show how they interact. It is used to identify the architecture design and is useful for tests of an architecture prototype.

* Development View:

The architecture partterns is a general solution that has as standards dealing with various issues in software engineering, such as computer hardware performance limitations, high availability and minimization of a business risk among others. In this project the architectural pattern followed is data modeling, a process used to define and analyze data requirements needed to support business processes within the corresponding information systems in organizations.
  
However, this process contains professional modelers who work in partnership with the business stakeholders, such as potential users of the information system.
