Introduction to Software Architecture:

  Software architecture is the process of creating/implementing a development pattern to structure the software system, detailing on how to create and link the different data structures as well as documentating them.
Having a well-thought software architecture helps working together as a team, and keeping the software stable and bug-free when scalating, while keeping it's design patterns. It's also helps visualize much better the software structure and know where to implement the next feature or where could be the bug that is being traced.
