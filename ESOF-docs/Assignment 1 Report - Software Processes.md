 ESOF 2016/2017 - Assignment 1: Sofware Processes

 DuckDuckGo was founded by Gabriel Weinberg in February 29th 2008 with the idea of a better search engine, with less spam.The name of this company comes from the children's game, duck, duck, goose. In 2009 DuckDuckGo decided not to collect user information and go Anonymous, unlike other major search engines. By September 17th 2014, apple begins to include DuckDuckGo to Safary with the lauch of iOS 8, as so did Mozilla. Nowadays DuckDuckGo has more than 10 million searches a day, and its major caracteristic is its anonymity, which is what made it what it is today.

 After making contact with Caine Tighe, 1st employee of DuckDuckGo, he said that their work follows the Software prototyping model


It could be used as an alternative the method of “Incremental development and delivery”, that is development in steps, since idea, implementation, test and maintenance, generating less documentation for changes, and which has frequency of client feedback for solve the important failures on system for do not have assumptions that cause errors, with this the systems services with higher priority received more test, improving the performance of the same, differently the method of “Software prototyping”, from customer feedback new changes are made and continue the process until the customer is satisfied with the product, losing time for make the product that usually will be “discarded”.

The disadvantage can arise relatives problems on the system architecture, because  tends to degrade with news increments, spending more money to modify a software system to improve the internal structure the same, becoming more expensive and complex.
